    "On trying to install Plotly, I found I couldn't import it. It turned out I installed it in the correct environment, but when I started the notebook I did not have the environment activated. It was therefore using a different binary, without Plotly installed. This [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39718367/unable-to-import-plotly-into-jupyter-notebook) pointed me in the right direction. You can use `sys.executable` to check which Python you are currently using.\n"
